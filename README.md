# Adrenaline_Experience
Hello and thank you for checking out my project! This is my Capstone project from my Undergraduate Degree at the University of Denver. It is a skydiving experience created using Unity to bring together the functionality of the Oculus Rift and Xbox Kinect in a single setting.

Here are some things you may need to know.

## General things
This was created in Unity 4.6 and has not yet been tested in 5. This is why I suggest that you use 4.6 until I get it working with 5. I also ran this on the 0.4.4 Oculus SDK, so I need to update and test new SDKs.  
It is expected that you have and Oculus Rift, that is already setup with a functioning SDK and drivers(Try use 0.4.4 if you can). It is also expected that you have an Xbox Kinect setup with the correct drivers to work with your computer.

### How to setup Unity project:
1. Create a new Unity project and then close Unity.
2. In your file explore locate the project folder.
3. Copy my "Assets" and "Project Settings" folders into your Unity project and replace all files.
4. Reopen Unity, and open the "grandcanyon" scene. Enjoy!

### Key presses:
I setup a few key-presses to make the exhibition run a little more smoothly. They are as follows:  
O: Kick out of helicopter  
R: Restart runtime/scene
